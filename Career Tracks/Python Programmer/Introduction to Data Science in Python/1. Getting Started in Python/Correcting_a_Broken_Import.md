In this exercise, we'll learn to import `numpy`, a module for performing mathematical operations on lists of data.The standard alias for `numpy` is `np`.What did you need to change to make the import run without errors?

# Instructions 

1. * Fix the import of `numpy` to run without errors.

```python
# Fix the import of numpy to run without errors

import numpy as np 
```
